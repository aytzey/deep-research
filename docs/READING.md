# Full-paper research guide

## Read the whole paper in Codex or Claude

Ask your agent:

> Find papers on <topic>. Use deep_read_topic, read each deep_reads[*].full_text batch,
> then call read_pdf_text with its pdf_path and next_cursor until null. Read every page,
> including references and appendices. Render figures and tables. Report unreadable pages
> and cite PDF page numbers; do not substitute abstracts or top_chunks for a full read.

`deep_read_topic` and `extract_local_pdf_text` deliver the first sequential text batch automatically.
For a specific PDF URL, call `inspect_open_access_pdf`, then `read_pdf_text` on its returned `pdf_path`.
Continue with the same path and the returned `start_page` / `start_char`. Each response carries at most
12,000 text characters by default; even an oversized page continues at the exact character.

The agent can request the **original PDF whenever the task needs it**, without first finishing text
reading: call `read_pdf_document`, then open the returned local file or fetch its MCP resource link
to receive the PDF bytes. Set `embed_base64=true` when the client supports embedded PDFs (within the
tool's size/page limits). Choose text, the PDF, or page images based on the task; receiving the file
alone does not establish that it was read.

| Reading option | What reaches the model | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract / `top_chunks` | Summary or selected, shortened excerpts | Discovery and navigation |
| `read_pdf_text` | Consecutive page text with a continuation cursor | Full-text reading in any MCP client |
| `render_pdf_pages` | Page images | Figures, tables, formulas, extraction checks |
| Local PDF / embedded PDF | File path or optional PDF bytes | Clients that support direct PDF inspection |

`extraction_status` and `pages_without_text` expose extraction gaps. PDFs need an extractable text layer;
pages without one are reported as unreadable. Text extraction can miss layout or symbols:
inspect relevant page images and disclose gaps.
PDFs are stored locally; returned text/images are sent to the configured AI client.

`end_of_document` means the cursor reached the end. It does **not** certify that the agent read earlier
batches. Reading packs and reports contain excerpts, and must not be presented as completed syntheses.

## Research a practical decision

For example: “I want to build a cheap circuit to measure plant-soil pH. Research the relevant
soil science, electrode materials and electronics, starting with recent work, and recommend
an approach I can build and validate.”

The MCP initialization instructions guide the agent to clarify the decision, split it into
discipline-specific questions, search recent work and foundational references, fully read decisive
papers, seek contradictory evidence, and compare alternatives under comparable conditions.
The final recommendation should include sources/pages, rejected alternatives, unresolved questions
and a first validation experiment. The agent performs the reasoning; the server supplies access
and reading tools. Instruction delivery alone does not guarantee the agent followed every step.

Start each discovery query with:

```python
search_literature(
    topic="soil pH reference electrode stability",
    sort_by="newest",
    open_access_only=False,
    limit_per_source=5,
)
```

Inspect `source_status`. To go deeper in one database, pass its `next_request` arguments back
to `search_literature` unchanged. A failed source has a `retry_request`; failure is not exhaustion.
Download the selected paper with `inspect_open_access_pdf(pdf_url=..., doi=...)`, then read its
text/PDF. This preserves the selection instead of rerunning a broad download pipeline.

`newest` requests native date ordering: publication dates where available, first submission for
arXiv, and year precision for DOAJ. Each record includes its date precision and source; partial
dates are not padded with invented days. Crossref date paging stops at 10,000 records; narrow
the query/year range to continue. Results cover returned provider pages, not the entire literature
in global date order. Metadata may be cached for `CACHE_TTL_SEC`; access and coverage gaps stay visible.
The existing default remains relevance ranking and `open_access_only=True`.

The detailed product scope and pH case are in [Research decisions](RESEARCH_DECISIONS.md).

## Configuration

**Use an available full-paper PDF directly. Unpaywall resolves missing or failed PDFs by DOI.**
Unpaywall uses `UNPAYWALL_EMAIL`, then `OPENALEX_EMAIL`, then `nomail@mail.com`
if both are missing or blank. A PDF URL is tried before making an extra lookup.
The integration follows the DOI/location model in the [roadoi guide](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roadoi/vignettes/intro.html)
using the existing Python Unpaywall v2 client; no R installation is needed.

When Unpaywall is needed, downloads try `best_oa_location` and then other `oa_locations` PDF URLs.
Landing pages and embargoed future locations are not treated as downloadable PDFs.
`paper.raw.unpaywall` exposes lookup status, OA locations and licensing metadata;
`paper.raw.pdf_download` identifies the copy actually downloaded. Email configuration is optional.
API failures are reported even
when OpenAlex supplies a fallback. DOI-less search records are marked
`not_applicable` and keep their direct OA access. Valid cached Unpaywall responses can be reused.
An openable PDF might still be a cover or abstract: the agent must inspect the content. In that case,
call `inspect_open_access_pdf(doi="...", pdf_url=None)` to request Unpaywall alternatives explicitly.

```bash
OPENALEX_EMAIL=you@example.com        # Optional contact email for API access
UNPAYWALL_EMAIL=you@example.com       # Optional; OPENALEX_EMAIL or nomail@mail.com is used otherwise
